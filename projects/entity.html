            Entity (2021) is an audio-visual installation generated from scraped
            tweets and carefully translated into sound and image. 
          </p>
          <p>
            The project began with a search of all tweets with the parameters:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><b>From:</b> ‘Anyone’</li>
            <li><b>Location:</b> ‘Near me’</li>
            <li><b>Language:</b> ‘English’</li>
            <li><b>Containing the exact phrase:</b> ‘I feel’</li>
            <li><b>Between the dates:</b> ‘01/03/2020’ and ‘29/02/21’</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            The results were scraped and the text of the tweets along with the
            corresponding dates extracted, becoming a list of sentiments, sorted
            by the date they were sent into the world. Each one was read and
            assigned a category:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Strongly negative</li>
            <li>Negative</li>
            <li>Lightly negative</li>
            <li>Neutral</li>
            <li>Lightly positive</li>
            <li>Positive</li>
            <li>Strongly positive</li>
            <li>Ambiguous</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Mapping these results became a score. Putting them to paper and
            noting any clear feelings expressed along the way (anger, humour,
            fear etc). 
          </p>
          <p>
            Each day of the dataset is given around 5 seconds within the track,
            and each tweet made that day is represented by a MIDI note, it’s
            qualities corresponding to it’s assigned category. Secondary
            observations like ‘anger’, ‘humour’ are also represented by distinct
            textural noises. The velocity of each note is in accordance with the
            strength of the sentiment being expressed. Everything belonging to
            the ‘negative’ categories is panned somewhat left, and vice versa
            positive and right. 
          </p>
          <p>
            A third layer of abstraction comes with the video, as the dates tick
            by, surrounded by an animation of particles programmed to shift with
            the volume of the track. 
          </p>
          <p>
            Entity has been an exercise in documenting, categorising, and
            outputting pieces of semi-chaotic information into one continuous
            stream, mirroring the mechanism of social media itself. Individual
            units of content all competing for our attention but ultimately
            becoming flattened, compressed and forgotten in the ‘feed’. 
          </p>
          <p>
            It is an attempt to take the shifting, unpredictable, hum of
            activity that takes place online and make a small part of it more
            tangible.
